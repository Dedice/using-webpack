# Webpack + ECMAScript6

How to use webpack with ECMAScript6 (ES6) for client-side fronend applications.


# Webpack is a flexible module bundler

If you are new to webpack, you may want to start by reading [this page](http://webpack.github.io/docs/).

In real-world webpack projects, we’ll separate the source files from the 
bundled files by organizing them in folders. For example, we’ll put the 
source files in "source" and bundled files in "build".

# JavaScript (ECMAScript6) reference / Statements and declarations

* The [export](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/export) 
statement is used to export functions, objects or primitives from a given file (or module).
* The [import](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import) 
statement is used to import functions, objects or primitives that have been exported from an external module, another script, etc.


# Brief Overview of ES6 Module Syntax

There are a few other variations of module syntax, the full list of all supported statements 
you can check [here](https://github.com/ModuleLoader/es6-module-loader/wiki/Brief-Overview-of-ES6-Module-syntax#user-content-all-supported-syntax).
